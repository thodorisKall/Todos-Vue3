# Vue 3 Todo App

## Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to practice and learn the basic concepts of Vue 3, especially the Composition API.

## Deployment

This project is not deployed yet. Once deployed, the URL will be added here (e.g., GitHub Pages or another platform).

## Description

This is a simple Todo app built with Vue 3. It allows users to add and delete Todo items. The app uses Vue's Composition API to manage state and handle events like adding and removing tasks. The app is responsive and easy to use.

An input field to add a new Todo.
- Buttons to add and delete Todos.
- A list displaying the Todos that have been added.

## Stack

- **Vue 3**: The frontend framework used to build the app.
- **SASS**: For styling the app and creating a simple user interface.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for app logic and interactivity.
- **HTML5**: The markup language used for structuring the app.

## Vision

The vision for this project is to improve the UI and add more features such as:

- A "Complete/Not Complete" icon for each Todo to track whether tasks are done or not.
- Enhancements for a better user experience, like animations and a more polished design.

## Stage of the Project

This project is currently in progress. The core features (adding and deleting Todos) are functional, but there are plans to add more features and deploy the app.
